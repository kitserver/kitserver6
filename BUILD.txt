BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================

The Makefile (in the src folder) is intended to be used by Microsoft NMAKE 
tool, which comes with Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.

All dependencies are included, so you do not need to install any other
software to build this program

Modify the setenv.vs2019.cmd so that it points to correct location
of your Visual Studio.

Two types of build are supported:

RELEASE:

    nmake

DEBUG:

    nmake debug=1

To delete all object files in preparation for clean re-build:

    nmake clean-all

Currently, the difference between "debug" and "release" builds is in the
way the debug configuration parameter is treated. The "release" build
ignores debug values > 1, while "debug" build provides more detailed 
logging for debug > 1. This behaviour, however, may change in the future.

(NOTE: You can also build the EXE and DLL files separately, using 
appropriate targets, specified in the Makefile.)
